# Description
This is a React based web app that allows you to view a list of students and their associated data (test averages, email addresses, etc).  Each students information can be expanded with the plus shaped icon on the right to view extended test score details and add or view tags. Students can simultaneously be filtered by name (first or last) and by tag with the search bars.  Tags are blank by default and are not persisted in any way.

Student data is fetched from a static json file simulating an external API call.  
This project was originally coded in one afternoon as part of a here unnamed company coding challenge, closely matching their style and functionality specifications.  At their request all references to said company and all use of their APIs have been removed for this public sample.
